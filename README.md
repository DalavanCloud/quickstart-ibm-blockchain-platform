## IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS

This Quick Start deploys an IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS distributed peer into the AWS Cloud.

A blockchain is a growing list of records, or blocks, that are linked and secured by using cryptography. The blockchain can be used as a distributed ledger. Peers, a key component of blockchain networks, maintain a copy of the ledger, endorse transactions, and host smart contracts. 

By using IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS, you can deploy peers on AWS and can store ledger data in your AWS environment. The distributed peers in AWS leverage the connection profile, Hyperledger Fabric certificate authorities (CAs), and the ordering service of an existing Enterprise Plan or Starter Plan network on IBM Blockchain Platform to process transactions.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS into a new VPC
- Deploying IBM Blockchain Platform for AWS into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
